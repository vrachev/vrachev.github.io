# Todos

* **P0** Figure out structure of /whoami.
* **P0** Figure out structure of /thisweek.
* **P1** Add RSS support for blog posts.
* **P1** Create /books page that contains all books I've read since ~2018.
* **P1** Move book objs out of /favorites page, since they'll be used in /books as well.
* **P2** Create /links page? Maybe? I want something to keep note of blog posts or other links, and I don't want to use /favorites for this. Maybe it'll resemble books where my favorite posts/links will end up in /favorites.
* **P2** Once P0s, P1s and (maybe) P2s are resolved, and publish. TBD on where I'll host.
* **P3** Create tags and functionality for searching by tags.
