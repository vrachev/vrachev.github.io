* **P1** Create /books page that contains all books I've read since ~2018.
* **P1** Publish.
* **P2** Create /links page? Maybe? I want something to keep note of blog posts or other links, and I don't want to use /favorites for this. Maybe it'll resemble books where my favorite posts/links will end up in /favorites.
* **P2** Make website good on mobile.
* **P3** Maybe: Create tags and functionality for searching by tags.
